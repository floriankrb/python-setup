To update the file size database :
  mkdir -p $HOME/.ncdudbs && ncdu $HOME                -o $HOME/.ncdudbs/home.db # do not do this too often, it puts a heavy load on the filesystem
  mkdir -p $HOME/.ncdudbs && ncdu /cnrm/vegeo/`whoami` -o $HOME/.ncdudbs/cnrm.db # do not do this too often, it puts a heavy load on the filesystem

To look at the database to find out in which folder you are using a lot of data :
  ncdu -f $HOME/.ncdudbs/cnrm.db # run this as often as you like
  ncdu -f $HOME/.ncdudbs/home.db # run this as often as you like'
